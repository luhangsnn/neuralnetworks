**ADALINE NN:** implements vanilla ADALINE and logistic adaline networks from numpy and performs binary classification and regression using the two networks. 

**Softmax and MLP**: implements a softmax layer and a multi-layer perception (MLP) network from numpy. The jupyter notebooks that follow the same naming convention tests, trains and optimizes performance on the STL-10 dataset.

**CNN and Optimizer:** implements a convolutional neural network from numpy with optimizer options to optimize training and predicting performances. 

**Transfer Learing and DeepDream:** Practices using python ML packages and pre-trained networks to apply to dataset on our choice with transfer learning techniques. To maximize the artistic (fun) ability of NN, we applied deep dream algorithm to our puppies!
